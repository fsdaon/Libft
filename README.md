# libft

Welcome to my **libft** project!

This is my own implementation of some of the most common functions from the C standard library, built during my time at 42 Vienna. The goal was to understand how things work under the hood instead of just using existing library functions.

## What’s Inside

Here’s a glimpse of what I implemented:

- **String functions:**
  - `ft_strlen`
  - `ft_strdup`
  - `ft_strlcpy`
  - `ft_strncmp`
  - ... and more!

- **Memory functions:**
  - `ft_memset`
  - `ft_memcpy`
  - `ft_memmove`
  - `ft_bzero`

- **Character checks & conversions:**
  - `ft_isalpha`
  - `ft_isdigit`
  - `ft_tolower`
  - `ft_toupper`

- **Linked list utilities (bonus part):**
  - `ft_lstnew`
  - `ft_lstadd_front`
  - `ft_lstsize`
  - `ft_lstclear`

…and a bunch of other useful tools!

## Why I Built It

This project taught me a lot about:
- Managing memory safely (no malloc leaks allowed!)
- Writing clean, reusable C code
- Thinking through edge cases
- Debugging some pretty stubborn bugs

It was challenging, but super satisfying to see all my functions pass the tests.

## Relevance for My Career

Working on libft was a great way to get comfortable with low-level programming and sharpen my problem-solving skills. I believe the experience I gained here is a solid foundation for any future software development work where efficiency, stability, and precise logic really matter.
